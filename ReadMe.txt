	App Design Overview - A tool to assist photographers in finding locations to take photos. Curated locations from other photographers; locations will be visible on a map and will show location information as well as example photos. The app will also include a shutter speed calculator for proper long exposure times. Personal locations can also be saved locally on the device. Locations that the photographer deems sharable can be published to an online database containing all of the shared locations viewable on a map. App design concepts are included in the 'Project Planning' folder.
