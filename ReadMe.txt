Final Project - ShutterTool

GitHub Repo: https://github.com/JoshLizak/CSC690_FinalProj.git

Milestone 1:
	Individual Project 
	Code Reviewers - None Yet
	
	App Design Overview - A tool to assist photographers in finding locations to take photos. Curated locations from other photographers; locations will be visible on a map and will show location information as well as example photos. The app will also include a shutter speed calculator for proper long exposure times. Personal locations can also be saved locally on the device. Locations that the photographer deems sharable can be published to an online database containing all of the shared locations viewable on a map. App design concepts are included in the 'Project Planning' folder.
		

Milestone 2:
	Designs are included in the project planning folder within this repo. The features listed there are the intended features of the app. The only items that are not yet finalized are whether Firebase will be used for the database management.

Milestone 3:
	All UI within the app was designed by myself and tested by myself and friends. UI is very similar to the designs submitted on the project planning phase.

Milestone 4:
	Project has been completed as a local app only. The networked database functionality using Google's firebase was not implemented. The application works as intended using CoreData to save data directly on the device's disk. Networked database functionality is intended for future iterations of the application. I will continue to work on the application as time goes on. I do intend on submitting this application to the App Store once it is in a more elegant state with all the features I am planning.
